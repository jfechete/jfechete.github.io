                    This is a program I started after getting a CNC machine. It creates .nc files from pictures, which are files that the CNC machine can use to be able to carve different shapes. I created it to learn more about how CNC machines work and to be able to easily engrave things. It accepts input as an image and can create a shape either by tracing the edges of colors, by tracing the center of lines, or by using the image as a heightmap.

                    This is a mobile application I created for a school project. It is a budgeting application to help users manage their spending. The settings tab allows the user to add or remove different budget categories. The spending tab is designed to allow users to quickly set the amount spent on an expense and drag it into its correct category. The statistics tab shows graphs of current and previous months, displaying how much they've spent so far and the predicted amount that will be spent over time.

                    This is a local website I've designed on my home network for family use. It has multiple different features, such as the account system shown. Another is a video uploading section, where family members can upload different videos to share with each other and receive comments on.
