                    This is a program I started after getting a CNC machine. It creates .nc files from pictures, which are files that the CNC machine can use to be able to carve different shapes. I created it to learn more about how CNC machines work and to be able to easily engrave things. It accepts input as an image and can create a shape either by tracing the edges of colors, by tracing the center of lines, or by using the image as a heightmap.

                    This is a mobile application I created for a school project. It is a budgeting application to help users manage their spending. The settings tab allows the user to add or remove different budget categories. The spending tab is designed to allow users to quickly set the amount spent on an expense and drag it into its correct category. The statistics tab shows graphs of current and previous months, displaying how much they've spent so far and the predicted amount that will be spent over time.

                    This is a local website I've designed on my home network for family use. It has multiple different features, such as the account system shown. Another is a video uploading section, where family members can upload different videos to share with each other and receive comments on.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made when I wanted to buy something from an online website. I wrote a bot that would check if there was an active sale on the item, and if there was, it would connect to a messaging app that I use and send me a notification. From there, I set it up to run every day and use it whenever I find another item I want, in order to see when it goes on sale.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made for my 3D printer. After I got a file that gave the 3D printer instructions on how to print, I would feed it into this program, and it would modify it so that between every layer, it would move the printing head away from the model and trigger a camera to take a picture of the object being printed. All of these pictures would then be combined into a video in order to create a clean time-lapse video without having the print head blocking the object being printed at any point.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made to organize different work-related documents. It has templates for the different types of documents needed, where I could select which one I wanted, and it would autofill certain fields, such as the date. It could also save customer information so that when I needed to make them another document, it would autofill in their information, which I gave it last time, instead of asking for it again. It also stored an index of all documents, so I could easily filter through them based on things like the client, date, or document type.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made because I have some devices around my house connected to the Wi-Fi, which I turn on to use sometimes. However, I sometimes forgot to turn them back off, and they would run all night, which could reduce their lifespan. To fix this, I created a program on a device that was always on and at midnight would connect to my other devices, and if it detected that they were on, it would put them to sleep, so they wouldn't remain on if I forgot about them.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made for a game studio that I co-own. It's a program on a server that all of our games connect to, where they send different analytical data about the game. The program then aggregates all the data and presents it to us in an easy-to-understand way. We have used this data to identify which parts of the game are too easy or difficult for players and have adjusted it to be more balanced.

                    <p>
                        This is a program I made for me and my friends while playing a game. It would often be chaotic trying to find a time when people were available and have everyone join the correct voice channels. To fix this, I created a bot on the messaging platform we used. People could request different times to play with the bot, and others could accept or decline. If it was confirmed, then everyone who accepted the invitation would get a notification at the set time. It would also automatically join people to the correct voice channel based on their team.
